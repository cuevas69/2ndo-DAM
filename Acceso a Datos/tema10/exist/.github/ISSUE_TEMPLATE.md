Thank you for reporting your issue!

To be able to better understand you problem or suggestion, please add as much information as possible to this ticket. When there is no or just little information, it will be too difficult to work on it (and hence we will not be able to solve it).

Please fill in the following sections:

### What is the problem
> Describe exactly what you see (e.g. an output of an XQuery) 

### What did you expect
> Describe what you expected to happen. Add for example a reference to a [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-3/).

### Describe how to reproduce or add a test
> Describe how we can can reproduce the problem.

> The *best* way is to provide an [SSCCE (Short, Self Contained, Correct (Compilable), Example)](http://sscce.org/). One type of SSCCE could be a small test which reproduces the issue and can be run without dependencies. The [XQSuite - Annotation-based Test Framework for XQuery](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/xqsuite.xml) makes it very easy for you to create tests. These tests can be executed from the [eXide editor](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/eXide/index.html) (XQuery - Run as Test)
