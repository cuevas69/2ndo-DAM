## Reporting a Vulnerability

***If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.***

Any security issues should be submitted directly to <security@exist-db.org>.
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

*   Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
*   Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. 
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, 
so if you're unsure, just email us at <security@exist-db.org>.

You can generally expect a response from the core developers within 48h.
